Simple Python-based implementation for the classification of mutations into indel (frameshift/in-frame), nonsense and missense substitutions as a teaching aid for the section on gene mutations in the A-level H2 biology syllabus. As such, this is not as a substitute for other more established variant prediction tools such as SIFT and VEP.
